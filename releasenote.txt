GoTrace
GoTrace integrates the collection of daily health survey
and location tracking data of the end-users on a digital and web platform to generate real-time, accurate, and reliable contact tracing reports.
Contact tracing with GoTrace becomes possible in three easy steps. To begin with, the end-user must register to create an account. Next, when the account has been confirmed, he/she will have access to the daily health survey form. A QR code is assigned to access the link for the health survey which will require the ID number of the end-user. Lastly, once the responses to the health survey are recorded, the end-user can now access the other QR codes in various locations on the campus or site.
